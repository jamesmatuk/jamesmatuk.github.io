I am a Data Scientist at the University of Pittsburgh. My current role is to provide statistical expertise for various research projects in the [Epidemiology Data Center](https://www.edc.pitt.edu/).

My research interests include longitudinal data analysis, statistical shape analysis, and Bayesian modeling. 

Before coming to the University of Pittsburgh, I was a Postdoctoral Associate in the [Department of Statistical Science](https://stat.duke.edu/) at [Duke University](https://duke.edu/). My advisors were Professor [David Dunson](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/dunson) and Professor [Amy Herring](https://globalhealth.duke.edu/people/herring-amy). 

I graduated with a Ph.D. in Statistics from the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.osu.edu/) at [The Ohio State University](https://www.osu.edu/).  My dissertation co-advisers were Professor [Oksana Chrekbtii](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/chkrebtii.1/research.html) and Professor [Sebastian Kurtek](https://www.asc.ohio-state.edu/kurtek.1/). 

In 2016, I graduated from [Duquesne University](https://www.duq.edu/academics/schools/liberal-arts/academics/departments-and-centers/mathematics-and-computer-science) with a B.S. in Mathematics. My undergraduate research focused on variational methods for image processing advised by Professor [Stacey Levine](https://www.duq.edu/academics/faculty/stacey-levine).
